--npm --save next react react-dom
to connect to the next server we modify the script in the
json file

'scripts': {
 'dev': 'next',
 'build': 'next build',
'start': 'next start'
}

next doesn't hav a directory like src in react so we have to 
create our own

--create pages folder and inside create index.js file

to run next server
-- npm run dev

ep.5
