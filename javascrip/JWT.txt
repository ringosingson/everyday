The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.

What is HTTP?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. 
The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

HTTP Methods
GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS
The GET Method
**GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
**POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
(The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:)

PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

(The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT 
request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects 
of creating the same resource multiple times.)

EPI 1--

npm init
npm install express
node . //to  start the server node space 
or
node index.js // with the name of the file

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8888;

now in cli if u type -- 
//export port=3000
and run node .
port will run in 3000 if you dont wpecify any port default is 8888

for POST
app.post('/login', (req, res) //the first argument is the route(/login)
second is callback(request and response)

--app.use(bodyParser.json()); //for reading the users body

status(200) // success
ep.6
if you have server running on different port
and you try to run fetch it will show access-control-origin error
here use cors library

ep.7
--$ export API_PORT=5000
