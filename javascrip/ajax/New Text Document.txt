Ajax - asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- the entire webpages doesn't need to reload while a small
portion of the page is change

--Use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL
 without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of 
   a page without disrupting what the user is doing

--The XMLHttpRequest method open() initializes a newly-created request, or re-initializes an
 existing one
 SYNTAX- XMLHttpRequest.open(method, url, async, user, password)

The --XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange-- property contains the event handler to be called when
 the readystatechange event is fired, that is every time the readyState property of the
 XMLHttpRequest changes.

Warning: This should not be used with synchronous requests and must not be used from native code.

SYNTAX-XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange = callback;
//callback is the function to be executed when the readyState changes.

The read-only --XMLHttpRequest.status-- property returns the numerical HTTP status code of the 
XMLHttpRequest's response.

Before the request completes, the value of status is 0. Browsers also report a status of 0 in case of 
XMLHttpRequest errors.	 * UNSENT: 0
   			 * OPENED: 0
                         * LOADING: 200
			 * DONE: 200

The read-only XMLHttpRequest property responseText returns the text received from a server 
following a request being sent.
SYNTAX -- var resultText = XMLHttpRequest.responseText;


The XMLHttpRequest method send() sends the request to the server. If the request is asynchronous 
(which is the default), this method returns as soon as the request is sent and the result is 
delivered using events. If the request is synchronous, this method doesn't return until the 
response has arrived.
SYNTAX-XMLHttpRequest.send(body)


The XMLHttpRequestEventTarget.onload is the function called when an XMLHttpRequest 
transaction completes successfully.
SYNTAX--XMLHttpRequest.onload = callback;
