Component- 
  1. building block of react
  2. combines logic(js) and presentation(jsx)

props-
 1. data passed to a component (or found via defaults)
 2. immutable: component cannot change its own props

STATE -
  1. internal data specific to a component
  2. data that changes over time

 thinking about state

1. in web applicatioin the user interface has to be stateful
2.logged in user see a different screen than looged-out user
3.clicking edit profile opens up a modal(pop up) window

response to events

STATE TRack two types of things on the client side
1. UI logic - the changing state of the interface. eg. modal open
  if you edit profile

2.Bussiness logic- the changing state of data 
          eg. in my inbox, message are either read or unread,
WHAT IS REACT STATE?

it's always an object(POJO-plain old javascript object), since you'll want to keep track
of several keys/values pair
